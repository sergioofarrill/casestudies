			<h2>THE WORK</h2>
		
			<div class="work-example">
				<h3>Website</h3>
				<p>
				We developed a new website framed around the patient’s experience. It was a huge undertaking: 7 separate pieces of research guided the development of 17 unique wireframe templates and designs, a custom SEO strategy was developed to optimize the website for search, 1,700 pages of content were created, 7 backend systems were integrated and all content was migrated to a Sitecore CMS system.

				<h3>BLOG</h3>
				<p>
				The James Blog plays a vital role by dynamically communicating the hospital's mission to patients as well as healthcare professionals. As a leader in cancer care and research, the blog created a platform that allowed the hospital to be a source for patient-friendly cancer updates and ground-breaking research news. The James Blog has become an integral part of the online ecosystem by driving significant traffic to the website and social channels.

				<h3>SOCIAL</h3>
				<p>
				Social media is a vital part of building a relationship with patients and fostering a community amongst patients and their families. We translated The James’ strategy and positioning to their social pagesso they became part of the brand. We then created a content strategy, reporting structure and promotional plan that helped increase their presence across the social space and tripled their levels of engagement.

				<h3>MAMM-O-GRAM APP</h3>
				<p>
				We developed a Mamm-o-Gram tablet application that allowed women to record video reminders to book a mammogram. The video could then be emailed to a friend or loved one, shared to the user’s social channels or sent to themselves 5 months later as a personal reminder. The app created buzz and user generated content that helped increase mammograms and clinical volume at The James by 20%.

				<h3>PAID CONTENT DISCOVERY</h3>
				<p>
				To drive our target audience to The James Blog, we ran a paid discovery campaign that pushed our content on select sites including MSN, NBC Fox, CNN and ABC. The campaign increased daily visits to the blog by 984% and increased unique visitors by 1,149%. As a result we saw an overall lift in traffic to our online properties, such as the website.
